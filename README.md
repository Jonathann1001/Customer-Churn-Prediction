# Customer-Churn-Prediction
At a multinational bank, customer retention is a top priority to ensure long-term business sustainability. With growing competition and evolving customer expectations, understanding the factors that drive customer attrition has become increasingly important. This project aims to build predictive models that identifies customers who are likely to leave the bank (i.e., churn), enabling proactive retention strategies.

# Data Source
I'm using a dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/raphaelmarconato/customer-churn-eda-balancing-and-ml-83-63/input) that contains information about 100,000 bank customers. The dataset includes features such as customer tenure, account balance, credit score, number of products held, and whether or not they exited the bank. The goal is to use this data to train machine learning models that can accurately predict customer churn and uncover key drivers behind it.
